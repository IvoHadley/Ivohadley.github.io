<p id="para1"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p id="para2">Space is very big. That much I’m sure you know already.<br>
Though, despite its size, there’s really not a lot in there.<br>
About 0.0000000000000000000042% percent of the observable universe contains stuff<sup><a href="#Cit1">[1]</a></sup>. That’s barely anything, right? Well, that 4.2 x 10<sup>-21</sup>% would actually take up about 1 billion cubic light years if it were all squashed together. A light year is a measure of distance, not time, as the name might imply. It’s the distance light travels in one year, which is about 950000000000 km, or 590000000000 miles.<br> 
That 1 billion cubic light years is a cube of side length 1,000 light years.<br>
It’s a little unfortunate that sizes like that aren’t really possible for humans to properly visualise, but that is properly massive. It just puts into perspective how large the observable universe is. And that’s only the observable universe. There’s a lot more to it than just what we can see.<br>
So, what exactly is in that mass of stuff?<br>
Good question. Mostly dark matter and dark energy.<br>
The thing is, neither of these have been observed directly, so we’re not exactly sure what they are. It’s just that their existence would answer questions we otherwise wouldn’t have answers for, which is how we know it’s there.<br>
They make up approximately 95.4% of all mass in the universe<sup><a href="#Cit2">[2]</a></sup>. The other 4.6% consists of atoms: Stuff that we definitely can observe, especially since we’re made of them as well.<br>
It’s mostly stars, dust, some black holes…<br>
And a small amount of it is planets, too, like Earth.<br>
Planets outside of our solar system are called ‘Exoplanets’.</p>
