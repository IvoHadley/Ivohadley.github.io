<p id="para1"><b>What is the James Webb Telescope?</b></p>

<img src="images/image17.png" class="img1"></img>

<p id="para2">We’ve sent quite a few telescopes into space in our time, perhaps the most famous of which being the Hubble Space Telescope. The James Webb Telescope, being developed by NASA, will succeed Hubble as NASA’s best space telescope, once we launch it the (hopefully) near future.<br>
It’s named after James E Webb, who was the second administrator for NASA, from 1961 to 1968<sup><a href="#Cit1">[1]</a></sup>.<br>
It has improved abilities over Hubble in pretty much every way, and observing exoplanets is just one of its many goals.<br>
What exactly are these abilities?<br>
In terms of things directly relating to the exoplanet search:<br>
It can see infrared wavelengths of light – light which we can’t see, which has a higher wavelength than the red end of the visible light spectrum. It can also see red and orange visible light. This infrared light can be translated into visible light images. A telescope called the Spitzer telescope did this, and the images turned out like <a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images" target="_blank">this</a>.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg18"></div>

<p id="para2">So, you can imagine Webb’s images will look pretty similar.<br>
The reason it measures infrared light is because of the redshift mentioned earlier. The universe is expanding, so stuff is moving away from us, which means pretty much everything we measure is redshifted to some degree. Webb measuring infrared light compensates for this.<br>
Webb can gather more light than Hubble and see things more clearly, and Webb can see so far that it can see light from just a quarter of a billion years after the big bang – for reference, the big bang was about 13.8 billion years ago.<br>
What exactly is Webb made of then, and how does it work?<br>
Webb is assembled from several parts all with different purposes.<br>
Here's our 3d model of the telescope:<br></p>

<p id="para1"><b>Sunshield</b></p>
<p id="para2">At the bottom of the telescope is several layers of what sort of looks like tin foil. That’s the Sunshield.<br>
As the name suggests, the sunshield protects the other components from being damaged by the heat and light of the sun. It’s about the size of a tennis court, and it will unfold after the telescope has been launched.<br>
The sunshield is made of five layers with gaps in between, an efficient way to dissipate the sun’s heat, even over that short distance. It needs to be effective, since the other components require incredibly low temperature to work.<br></p>

<img src="images/image20.png" class="img1"></img>

<p id="para1"><b>Spacecraft Bus</b></p>
<p id="para2">The main part of the telescope is the Spacecraft bus. It has a number of instruments inside it and has a number of purposes:<br>
-	It has a computer that stores information with solid state memory<br>
-	A communications dish that can point at Earth.<br>
-	Rocket engines that can control altitude precisely.<br>
-	It’s the main part that holds everything together. It’s very sturdy, since it needs to hold it during launch.<br></p>

<img src="images/image21.png" class="img1"></img>

<p id="para1"><b>Primary mirror</b></p>
<p id="para2">When you look at the James Webb Telescope, your eyes are probably immediately drawn to one thing. The giant yellow hexagonal part on top.<br>
Officially called the optical telescope element, it’s a giant mirror made up of 18 smaller hexagonal mirrors.<br>
The entire mirror is 6.5 meters across, and no mirror this large has ever been launched into space before<sup><a href="#Cit2">[2]</a></sup>. The hexagons make it roughly circular, but easy to fold up.<br>
In order to work, it needs to be at -220 degrees Celsius. That makes it pretty clear why the sunshield needs to be so good at cooling.<br>
It’s made mostly of Beryllium, an element that’s light, strong, and holds its shape for a wide range of temperatures.<br>
The yellow colour is given by a gold coating, which improves its ability to reflect infrared light.<br>
The primary mirror reflects light onto something called the Integrated Science Instrument Module.<br></p>

<img src="images/image22.png" class="img1"></img>

<p id="para1"><b>Integrated Science Instrument Module</b></p>
<p id="para2">That name doesn’t sound very descriptive, does it?<br>
To be more specific about what it does (yet still pretty simple), the Integrated Science Instrument Module takes the light reflected by the mirror and converts it into data to send back to Earth, using a sensitive infrared camera called NIRCam – pictured in the image above.<br>
An instrument called NIRSpec will be used to measure the near-infrared light of up to 100 objects in an area<sup><a href="#Cit3">[3]</a></sup>.<br>
There’s also the Mid infrared Instrument (MIRI for short) which is the same as NIRSpec but for mid infrared wavelengths of light.<br>
Then, there’s the Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Image and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS), and if you’re anything like me, your brain shut down halfway through reading that ridiculously long name.<br>
Unfortunately, it’s as complicated as it sounds. It can do:<br>
-	Near infrared imagery. It can take images using infrared light.<br>
-	Wide field slitless spectroscopy. What’s that?<br>
It’s a technique that uses a grism, which is the scientific name for a combination of a grid and a prism (yes, really) to disperse light. This is similar to how a normal prism disperses light – You’ve probably seen the image of white light entering a prism and a rainbow coming out of it. You’ll especially be familiar if you’re a fan of Pink Floyd. As white light is actually just a mixture of all other colours of light, prisms split this white light into these colours, hence the rainbow. In simple terms, this grism does the same sort of thing, which allows it to look for exoplanets by using the light given off by their stars.<br>
-	Single object slitless spectroscopy.<br>
Now that you know what Wide field slitless spectroscopy is, this one should make a little more sense – it’s the same thing, but for one object instead of an area. It can be used to measure the elements a star is composed of, and even the components of a planet orbiting it, through that absorption spectrum mentioned earlier.<br>
-	Aperture masking interferometry.<br>
Interferometry is a family of techniques where in which waves are superimposed (moved over each other) and the interference caused is used to extract information. It’s very hard to explain, but the basic gist of it is: It uses holes in an ‘aperture masking disc’ and will allow for the detection of exoplanets with certain ranges of light and types of star.<br>
It will also contain something called a cryocooler<sup><a href="#Cit4">[4]</a></sup>. Cryocoolers cool things using cryogens. Cryogens are materials with a boiling point below -150 Celsius, or 120 Kelvin. This means they would be gases even in the coldest place on Earth in Antarctica. They need to be cooled an extreme amount to condense into a liquid. Webb operates at temperatures as cool as -266 Celsius, or 6 Kelvin. For reference, 0 kelvin is the coldest temperature physically possible.<br>
So, why does Webb need to be so ridiculously freezing cold? At this temperature, it’s so cold that the oxygen in the air would freeze solid. <br>
Well, as mentioned before, Webb detects infrared light. Infrared light constantly is given off by absoultely everything, including us humans (expect things at 0 kelvin) and the hotter something is, the more infrared radiation it emits (infrared radiation is just another way of saying light with an infrared wavelength).<br>
So, the reason Webb needs to be so cold, is because if it were too hot, it would end up detecting its own infrared radiation – it needs to be cold enough to not detect itself.<br></p>

<p id="para1"><b>Overview</b></p>
<p id="para2">Webb will be able to do quite a lot.<br>
It will be the greatest space telescope the world has once it’s launched, and it uses some incredible technology that has taken years to develop.<br>
…A few more years than was hoped, actually.<br>
Webb’s launch date has been pushed back many times due to delays and complications in its construction. The original launch date was October 2018 but judging by the fact it’s still very much grounded, that clearly didn’t go to plan.<br>
Relevant <a href="https://xkcd.com/2014/" target="_blank">XKCD</a>.<br>
<img src="images/image32.png" class="img1"></img><br>
At the start of making this website, Webb’s planned launch date was March 30th, 2021. Thanks to complications caused by COVID, the date is now October 31st, 2021<sup><a href="#Cit5">[5]</a></sup>. It will be launched from Kourou, French Guiana, in the northeast of South America.<br> 
After launch, the telescope will travel on a 30-day, million-mile journey to its orbit point – Lagrange point (L2).<br>
A Langrangian point, or Lagrange point for short, are points between two large bodies in space. At these points, the gravitational forces of the two points are equal, so any object placed in a Lagrange point will just sit there, not being pulled towards either object.<br>
Lagrange point 2 is past Earth, the other side of it from the sun. This is a good point for Webb as it allows for communication with Earth, solar power from the sun, and it can observe out into space without the sun blocking its view for the most part.<br>
Once Webb arrives there, it won’t be ready to go for about 6 months as it needs to prepare. Equipment needs to cool and be calibrated. Then, it will be ready for use.<br>
Hopefully, Webb will last for at least 10 years of observation, and there’s a good chance it will last for more. Space instruments do have a tendency to last longer than expected: Curiosity landed in 2012 for a two-year mission, and as of 26/08/2020, it’s still going.<br>
As said before, James Webb will have many purposes, of which discovering exoplanets is just one, but it will be the best instrument we have for this once it finally launched.<br>
Who knows, maybe it will finally be the instrument we use to discover aliens?<br>
That is, if they’re out there at all.</p>
