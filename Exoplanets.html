<p id="para1"><b>What is an Exoplanet?</b></p>
<p id="para2">There are a lot more planets out there than just the eight (sorry, Pluto) in our solar system. Some of them are smaller than mercury. Others are bigger than Jupiter. And some are a lot like Earth.<br>
They’re known as Extrasolar planets, or Exoplanets for short, with the prefix Exo- meaning ‘out of’.<br>
It’s important to note that the definition of a planet is an object that orbits around a star, which is large enough for its own gravity to shape it into a mostly spherical shape.<br>
As of 11/08/2020, according to the Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia<sup><a href="#Cit1">[1]</a></sup>, a comprehensive database of exoplanets, there are 4302 confirmed exoplanets.<br>
</p>

<div class="bgimg2"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>So, what makes a planet? Here’s a few fun facts: </b></p>
<p id="para2">Confirmed exoplanets have a pretty wide range of masses. The least massive known planet is <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wd_1145%2B017_b/" target="_blank">WD 1145+017 b.</a> It has a mass 0.00067 times the Earth. That’s 4x10<sup>21</sup>kg, making Earth almost 1500 times more massive, and the moon about 18 times more so. As said before, a planet is an object orbiting around a star. Even though it’s smaller than the moon, since it's orbiting a star, it’s a planet, whereas the moon is orbiting Earth, thus making it not a planet.<br>
The largest planet can’t be said for sure. It’s difficult to determine whether something is a planet, or a brown dwarf – the smallest type of star. The largest exoplanets are estimated to be about 12 times as massive as Jupiter.<br>
</p>

<div class="bgimg3"></div>

<p id="para2">Though, having the lowest mass doesn’t mean the smallest radius. For example, while <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wd_1145%2B017_b/" target="_blank">WD 1145+017 b.</a> has the lowest mass, the planet with the smallest radius is the succinctly named <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/sdss_j1228+1040_b/" target="_blank";>SDSS J1228+1040b.</a> It has a radius of 0.0009 times that of Jupiter, or roughly 65km. Though, this is really pushing what the definition of an exoplanet is – This planet is essentially just the leftover iron core of a planet – so it would be a little dishonest to say that this is definitively the smallest. The safest bet would probably in fact be <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/wd_1145%2B017_b/" target="_blank">WD 1145+017 b</a> yet again, with a radius of roughly 1000km – quite a lot bigger.<br>
As for the exoplanet with the largest radius – that would be <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/tyc_8998-760-1_b/" target="_blank">TYC 8998-760-1 b.</a> It has a radius of roughly three times that of Jupiter, or about 214,000 km. It orbits a star that’s only 17 million years old. And yes, I said ‘only’, as in terms of space, that time is absolutely tiny. This star is so young, it didn’t exist when the dinosaurs did.<br>
(Note: There is one possibly larger planet, <a href="http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/HD%20100546%20b/" target="_blank">HD 100546 b,</a> though its existence is a bit shaky. It’s reported to have a radius of 6.9 times that of Jupiter, but in reality, the Exoplanet Catalogue lists its status as unconfirmed for a number of reasons.)<br>
</p>

<div class="bgimg4"></div>

<p id="para2">The temperature range for exoplanets is quite high as well. The hottest known exoplanet is <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-70_b/" target="_blank">Kepler-70b</a>, with a temperature of roughly 7,700 Kelvin, or 7,400 Celsius. That’s hotter than our own sun by about 2,000 Kelvin. It’s believed it and it’s fellow exoplanet Kepler-70c survived the expansion of the star they orbit, where the star became a red giant. The two were most likely once gassy planets that had their outer layers vaporised by the star when this happened.<br>
The coldest known exoplanet is <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/ogle-2016-blg-1195-lb" target="_blank">OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb</a>. Its exact temperature is not known, but estimates are around 50 Kelvin, or -220 Celsius. The reason for this is that the star it orbits around may not even be a star at all, since it’s so small and cold itself. Sometimes, the planet is referred to as Hoth thanks to its extreme temperature, though I think if Hoth was this cold, Luke would have frozen to death the moment he left his ship. <br>

<div class="bgimg5"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>A few other star systems and exoplanets that are interesting, or just plain cool: </b></p>
<p id="para2">I’m sure many people reading this will know about Tatooine: The planet from the Star Wars franchise that has two suns. Ridiculous, right? Not at all, in reality. There are a few exoplanets that have been found to orbit two stars at once. But I can do you better than that. No, I’m not talking about a planet that orbits three stars…<br>
…But how about a planet that orbits four? <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-64_(ab)_b/" target="_blank">PH1b</a>, also known by its NASA designation Kepler-64b - the planet orbits a close binary system (A two-star system), with another binary system orbiting further away.<br>
We’ve mentioned the hottest known Exoplanet, but sometimes, hot planets are sometimes more interesting when they’re not just burning balls. <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/corot-7_b/" target="_blank">CoRoT-7b</a> is an extremely hot exoplanet, at around 1500 Kelvin. CoRoT-7b is most likely a planet covered entirely by lava. It was the first discovered of its kind, in fact, and lava-ocean planets were proposed as a new class thanks to CoRoT-7b’s discovery. Though, further study has shown the planet’s chemical composition is a lot like Earth’s.<br>
Though a lava planet is cool, it’s certainly wouldn’t be pleasant. But perhaps a little more habitable would be the opposite of a lava planet: an ocean planet. The primary example of a likely ocean planet is <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1214_b/" target="_blank">GJ 1214 b</a>. it’s even got the nickname ‘the waterworld’. It’s significantly larger than Earth, but smaller than the biggest planets in the solar system. NASA has reported that it may even have clouds. That being said, the planet’s temperature is estimated to be around 120-290 Celsius, and it has mostly lost its atmosphere, so maybe avoid this one if you’re looking for somewhere to swim.<br>
And finally, a planet called <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/hd_80606_b/" target="_target">HD 80606 b</a>. The question with this planet is not what is wrong with it, but rather, what isn’t. This planet’s orbit is far more like an oval than a circle. At its closest point to its star, it’s about 4,500,000 km away – just closer than Mercury – but at its furthest point, it’s about 131,000,000 km away – almost as far as Earth. This means it has the most eccentric orbit of any known planet – Where eccentricity basically means how far from a perfect circle the shape of the orbit is.<br>
At the furthest point away, it would receive radiation about equal to Earth. At its closest point, it receives about 800 times more. This means the temperature rises from 800 Kelvin / 500 Celsius to 1500 Kelvin / 1200 Celsius in just six hours as it's swung past the star. When it passes close to the star, it moves far faster than when it's far away as well.<br>
This also means the planet has some wild weather. The rapid rise in heat causes ‘shock wave storms’ with winds that blow about fifteen times faster than the speed of sound.<br>

<div class="bgimg6"></div>

<p id="para2">So, there’s quite a few examples of just how crazy planets in the universe can get. And that was just scratching the surface. But, as the massive variations in the properties of the planets makes obvious, exoplanets can be very different from each other, so much so that you often can’t tell that they’re all planets.<br>
Of course, this means that you can’t just lump them all under the title of exoplanet and call it a day there: There are many different types of planet.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg7"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The different types of Planet</b></p>
<p id="para2">Terrestrial: Also known as rocky planets. There are planets primarily composed of rock and metal. Examples include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.<br>
Gas Giant: A gas giant is a giant planet composed of mostly hydrogen and helium. As a result of being mostly gaseous, they don’t really have a ‘surface’. Though, deep inside them, they’re thought to have molten rocky cores. The pressure on the cores deep inside these planets is very high, since they have so much gas on top of them. Examples include Jupiter and Saturn.<br>
Ice Giant: An ice giant is a giant planet composed of mostly elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Not necessarily ice, though, which is a little confusing. In astrophysics, ‘ices’ are chemical compounds with freezing points above 100 kelvin, so water is included. Examples include Uranus and Neptune (Not gas giants as they are often called. It was discovered in the 1990s that they don’t have nearly as much hydrogen and helium as Saturn and Jupiter, thus they were given a separate class)<sup><a href="#Cit2">[2]</a></sup>.<br>
Dwarf planets: These are objects big enough to be classified as planets, but do not clear out their orbit. What this means is that for a dwarf planet to become an actual planet, its gravity needs to clear all the other objects out of its orbital path. Examples include Pluto, Ceres, and Eris.<br>
Super-Earths: A planet with mass a decent amount below an ice giant like Uranus or Neptune, but also higher than Earth’s. Though, the name ‘Earth’ does not mean it’s habitable. Some of the more massive super Earths can be more gaseous and are sometimes referred to as mini-Neptunes. Examples include two previously mentioned planets, <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/gj_1214_b/" target="_blank">GJ 1214 b</a> and <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/corot-7_b/" target="_blank">CoRoT-7b</a>.<br>
Hot Jupiters: These are planets similar to Jupiter, except that they orbit very close to their stars, thus they are far hotter than Jupiter is. They make up a large portion of the planets we’ve found, not necessarily because they’re the most common, but because they’re the easiest to detect. Why? We’ll get into that later. Examples include <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/51_peg_b/" target="_blank">51 Pegasi b</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2005/050711/full/news050711-6.html" target="_blank">HD 188753 b</a>.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg8"></div>

<p id="para2">So, those are the main types of planet. But that’s not all the types there are. Some are a bit too specific, so I left them out, but there are a couple more I want to mention just because they’re interesting, despite not applying to that many known planets, or not being potentially real in the first place:<br>
Rogue Planets: Planet sized objects that don’t orbit any star. They were either shot out of their star system, or they formed outside of them in the first place. The Milky Way might have billions of these. The thing is, small cold objects are pretty much impossible to detect when they’re not close to any bright and obvious stars, so we don’t know of very many of them. Most of the ones we have found are as yet unconfirmed. One of the few confirmed rogue planets is <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/pso_j318.5-22/" target="_blank">PSO J318.5-22</a>.<br>
Chthonian planets: A Hypothetical class of planet. These would be formed by a gas giant having all of its hydrogen and helium stripped away, most likely because of being too close to a star. As this would leave a metal, rocky core, these planets would be quite similar to terrestrial planets<sup><a href="#Cit3">[3]</a></sup>.<br>
Super-puff: Yes, that’s really the name of a very real class of planet. Super-puff planets are ones with a mass a few times more than Earth, yet a radius larger than Neptune. This means they have a very low density, hence the name. They’re big puffy balls of gas. An example of a super-puff planet is <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/kepler-87_c/" target="_blank">Kepler-87c</a>.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg9"></div>

<p id="para2">We seem to know quite a lot about exoplanets, right? Well, not really. We estimate there are over 100 billion planets in the galaxy. And so far, we’ve confirmed 4302. That’s 0.0000043% of the planets in our galaxy alone – and 100 billion is a low estimate. It’s extremely likely there are planets out there far weirder than any we’ve found before.<br>
So, how did we find these planets in the first place, and how come there are so many that we have yet to find at all?<br>
The first evidence of an exoplanet was found in 1917, but they didn’t realise at the time it meant a planet outside the solar system. The first proper detection came in 1988, with the first confirmation a few years later in 1992. This first discovery was of planets orbiting around the pulsar <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7135/psr-b125712-c/" target="blank">PSR B1257+12</a>. This planet was discovered due to irregularities in the pulses emitted by the star. A planet orbiting the star was the best explanation.<br>
How do we usually discover exoplanets now?<br>
