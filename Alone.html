<p id="para1"><b>Are we alone?</b></p>
<p id="para2">One of the biggest questions of the modern era.<br>
We’ve been wondering this for decades – are there any other civilisations out in space?<br>
The thing is, we’ve actually known that answer for ages. The answer is…<br>
Who knows? We have no way of telling, and anyone who tells you they know for sure is lying. We just don’t know.<br>
But that doesn’t mean we can’t guess.<br>
You may have heard of something called the drake equation. This was an equation written in 1961 by astrophysicist Frank Drake. The equation is a way to estimate the number of civilisations in the milky way capable of communicating across space.<br>
It's important to emphasise that this is an estimation, and is not to be taken as an exact answer. How about we give it a go, and see just how unreliable it is?<br>

<div class="bgimg25"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The Drake equation</b></p>
<p id="para2">The equation is:<br>
N = R<sub>*</sub> x f<sub>p</sub> x n<sub>e</sub> x f<sub>l</sub> x f<sub>i</sub> x f<sub>c</sub> x L<br>
Okay, so what does any of that mean?<br>
-	N is the result of the equation and what we’re trying to find: The number of Milky Way civilisations capable of communicating across space.<br>
-	R<sub>*</sub> is the average rate of star formation in the galaxy. According to NASA, the current rate of star formation is 0.68-1.45 solar masses per year<sup><a href="#Cit1">[1]</a></sup>. Based on the average mass of a star, this gives a star formation rate of about 1.5-3 stars per year. Let’s take a conservative estimate and say 1.5.<br>
-	f<sub>p</sub>  is the fraction of stars that have planets. As stated before, we think stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception. So this value is probably very close to one. Again, let’s take a low estimate and say 0.9.<br>
-	n<sub>e</sub> is the average number of planets that might support life per star that has planets. This is a very difficult one to estimate. From before, NASA estimates 40 billion earth sized planets in habitable zones in our galaxy. Taking our value of number of stars in the galaxy as 250 billion like we did in the first section, this means 16% of stars have an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone.<br>
Now, we have to make a big assumption: How many of these support life. Optimistically, we could say all of them, but let’s take another low estimate and say half. So, 16% / 2 = 8%. This makes our value of n<sub>*</sub> 0.08.<br>
-	f<sub>l</sub> is the fraction of the above that actually develop life. Yet another difficult estimate. The only planet we have to go by is earth, which would make us think this value is quite close to 100%. Again, let’s say 0.9 to be safe.<br>
-	f<sub>i</sub> is the fraction of the above that develops intelligent life. Also very hard to estimate. Again, going off Earth, that value would be 100%, but we have no way of knowing if that would be the same across the entire galaxy. The creator of the equation, Frank Drake, estimated this value as 0.3, so let’s use that.<br>
-	f<sub>c</sub> is the fraction of the above that reveals their existence through a broadcast into space. The one example we have – us – has been sending signals into space for decades. It’s very likely that if a civilisation had the technology to send these signals that they would send them out into space whether they wanted to or not. The first radio signals we sent went out into space, but that’s not why we sent them. It’s very likely that this value is also close to 1, as it’s very unlikely a civilisation would deliberately hide their presence, or even be able to do so. Let’s be careful and use 0.9.<br>
-	L is the lifetime of such a civilisation sending its signals into space. Essentially, for how long could they send these signals? This brings up the rather depressing question of how long we will last. With threats like climate change looming over us, a realistic estimate of this value is difficult to estimate, but we can safely use a minimum value of at least 300 or so years. If we were to overcome climate change, then this value could be WAY larger – Drake himself estimated this value to be about 10,000, which is honestly just as reasonable as 300.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg26"></div>

<p id="para2">So, our Drake equation estimate is:<br>
N = 1.5 x 0.9 x 0.08 x 0.9 x 0.3 x 0.9 x 300<br>
Which means N = 7.87<br>
And that was using low estimates all the way through, so according to the Drake Equation, there are probably at least a few alien civilisations sharing the galaxy with us. We could try a higher, possibly more realistic equation:<br>
A recent paper by scholars at the University of Nottingham<sup><a href="#Cit2">[2]</a></sup> found that fl fi and fc are probably all equal to 1. If we take Drake’s estimate of L being 10,000 and the upper estimate of star formation, being 3, and redo the equation, we get:<br>
N = 3 x 0.9 x 0.08 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 10,000<br>
Which makes N = 2160<br>
That’s a lot of civilisations.<br>
But that’s also quite inaccurate, isn’t it?<br>
We changed a few estimates and got a value 275 times greater than the one we had before. And that was just using our own estimates. Answers to the equation can range from basically 0 to several million.<br>
As I said before, this equation is extremely inaccurate, and meant to be taken only as an estimate. It’s mostly conjecture – everything other than the rate of star formation and the fraction of stars that have planets is just a complete guess, and even those are estimates.<br>
At the very least, it’s a nice way to get an idea of whether or not we’re alone.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg27"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The Fermi Paradox</b></p>
<p id="para2">However, there’s one thing that doesn’t make much sense about this.<br>
If there are potentially thousands of alien civilisations out there, then why haven’t we heard from any of them yet?<br>
There’s actually a term for that: The Fermi paradox. Specifically, the Fermi paradox is the contradiction between the lack of evidence of alien civilisations, and the high estimates of the probability of their existence, with which the Drake equation is a popular example.<br>
The obvious answer to this is that space is just so big, and we’ve barely sent out our own signal into it yet.<br>
So that begs the question, just how far out have we broadcast our existence?<br>
Since we can look at radio signals from other star systems, it’s safe to assume aliens looking for us would look for the radio signals that we emit. We’ve been broadcasting our signal for a little under 100 years, so a bubble in space with a radius of 100 light years would be the area we’ve covered.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg28"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>So, what might be the first signal of ours aliens see?</b></p>
<p id="para2">That could be Nazi Germany’s telecast of the 1936 Olympic games opening ceremony<sup><a href="#Cit3">[3]</a></sup>.<br>
Yes, it’s possible that the first thing aliens would hear from us would be Hitler, as he was pretty prominently featured in the broadcast, which was a monumental step forward for television. It reached 41 countries across the planet.<br>
Let’s just hope they don’t assume he’s an example of the rest of us, then.<br>
This wasn’t the first radio signal we sent, but it was the most powerful sent in its time, so it’s the first one likely to travel a long distance out into space. Signals would need to be powerful enough to pass through the Earth’s atmosphere, which is pretty good at blocking radiation, as if it didn’t, the sun would’ve caused quite a big problem.<br>
This signals could potentially go hundreds of light years into space, but it would be very weak and unlikely to be detected by any aliens far enough away – so, while it’s very unlikely this is the first thing aliens would see, it’s the first signal that could be possible.<br>
So, as stated before, we’ve covered an area 100 light years in radius so far.<br>
Taking the galaxy as a flat circle, as in the grand scheme of the universe, it basically is, we can determine what percentage of the galaxy we’ve broadcast our signal into.<br>
The milky way has a diameter of roughly 100,000 light years<sup><a href="#Cit4">[4]</a></sup>.<br>
Using pi x r<sup>2</sup> we can find the area of the galaxy, which is 7,850,000,000 light years<sup>2</sup>.<br>
The area we’ve covered – a circle with diameter 200 light years – is 126,000 light years<sup>2</sup>.<br>
Dividing the area of the galaxy by the area we’ve covered and multiplying by 100 gives us the percentage of the galaxy we’ve covered, being just 0.0016%.<br>
So perhaps our somewhat pathetic coverage is why we’ve never been contacted. Just like we don’t know if aliens are out there, there’s a very good chance they couldn’t find us either.<br>
But that’s just the milky way.<br>
The size of the observable universe is an unfathomable amount larger, a sphere of diameter around 92 billion light years<sup><a href="#Cit5">[5]</a></sup>. It’s not really even worth calculating how little into it we’ve broadcast ourselves.<br>
But in case you're curious, using these numbers, the area of the universe receiving our radio signals is:<br>
0.0000000000000019% of the observable universe.<br>
So we’ve got a little ways to go, then.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg29"></div>

<p id="para2">The thing is, we’ve never received any alien signals either. Do they have the same low coverage? Perhaps. But it’s also possible there are alien civilisations that have been sending radio signals for far, far longer than we have.<br>
It’s also possible that there are aliens within our sphere of influence, just not advanced enough to receive these signals.<br>
There could even be such aliens in our very own solar system.<br>
There could be single celled life on Saturn’s moon titan, for example – there could be liquid water beneath its surface capable of harbouring life.<br>
Anyway, as said before, the Nazi Germany message was (perhaps thankfully) very weak. So, what about something we meant to send out there?<br>
The first message we sent out into space with the express purpose of finding aliens was the Arecibo message, sent in 1974.<br>
You may have seen this image before:<br></p>

<img src="images/image30.png" class="img2"></img>

<p id="para2">Image by Arne Nordmann (norro), CC BY-SA 3.0, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=365130" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=365130</a><br>
The message was aimed at a large and close collection of stars – this was before we knew where any exoplanets were, so we just shot it at where they were most likely to be.<br>
It’s also 25,000 light years away, which means the first possible date for us to receive an answer would be in 49954 years.<br>
But let’s forget about that slight problem for now. The radio message sent forms the image above when translated into graphics.<br>
At first glance, it doesn’t seem to make a lot of sense, but every single pixel has a purpose, and the message as a whole is meant to send information about earth and humanity.<br>
From the top down:<br>
The white pixels at the top represent the numbers one to ten in binary, each with a marker at the bottom representing where the least significant digit is (the digit furthest to the right).<br>
The pink pixels beneath it represent the elements that make up DNA by referencing their atomic numbers in binary.<br>
The mess of green pixels beneath that are the molecular formula of the molecules that make up DNA, using the elements represented in pink above it.<br>
And the blue waves at the middle are the familiar double helix shape of DNA itself. The white bar in the middle of it represents the number of these pink molecules in DNA, which here is set at 4.3 billion.<br>
The most recognizable part of this image is the depiction of a human in red beneath the DNA. The number on the left indicates the average height of a male in the US, and the number on the right is the human population of humans on Earth when this message was sent.<br>
Beneath that in yellow is a representation of our solar system, with Earth raised above the others. Interestingly, Pluto is included as well, as at the time this message was sent, it was still considered a planet.<br>
The big pink thing beneath it is the Arecibo radio telescope, which sent the message. The white pixels beneath it are its diameter in binary.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg31"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p id="para2">A lot of information was packed into that little message. We just have to hope that aliens receiving it can decipher it.<br>
Or if aliens receive it at all.<br>
We’ve sent plenty since as well, to various other locations in the galaxy.<br>
Maybe someday we’ll get a reply?<br>
Maybe there are aliens out there that have already heard us.<br>
If you have time, please complete this short survey about your opinion: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/GHZPN8V" target="_blank">survey</a><br>
Again, all I can say is we really just don’t know. But that’s part of what’s so amazing about space. There’s so much we don’t know, which means there are so many amazing discoveries still left to make.<br>
For now, we can only keep searching, because what else can we do?<br>
Keep yelling into the eternal void of space,<br>
“Hello, is anyone there?”<br></p>
