<p id="para1"><b>How do we find exoplanets?</b></p>
<p id="para2">There are quite a few different methods we use to find planets outside our solar system, though some are much more effective than others.<br>
So far, the most effective method – especially in more recent years – is called the Transit Photometry method, or just the Transit method for short.<br>
</p>

<div class="bgimg10"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The transit method</b></p>
<p id="para2">Fortunately, the transit method is quite simple.<br>
It uses the brightness of the star the planet is orbiting around.<br>
Stars emit light. Shocking, right?<br>
The light stars give off is also VERY easy to detect. On a clear night, you can easily do it without any equipment at all, just by looking up. Now, if you can detect them with the naked eye, imagine how easy it is for the powerful telescopes we can look into space with.<br>
They can detect miniscule changes in the light given off by stars hundreds of light years away.<br>
What would case tiny changes in the light the stars give off?<br>
If a planet moved in front of it, the star would appear to dim a little, as the planet blocks some of the light.<br>
And that’s the transit method!<br>
Planets are detected due to them causing fluctuations in the brightness of a stars’ light as they pass in front of them.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg11"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>However, this method allows us to find out more than just if a planet is there.</b></p>
<p id="para2">By measuring how much the planet’s light dips, and the mass of the star, we can determine the mass of the planet detected as well.<br>
As said previously, most of the exoplanets we know were discovered with this method. The famous Kepler space telescope used this method to discover hundreds of exoplanets by surveying approximately 150,000 stars<sup><a href="#Cit1">[1]</a></sup>. It even found some earth like planets as well.<br>
We can find what’s in the planet’s atmosphere using something called an absorption spectrum, which uses the wavelengths of the light that passes from the star through the planet’s atmosphere. By the wavelengths that come through, we can tell what elements the planet’s atmosphere is made up of.<br>
So overall, the transit method is pretty effective and pretty useful. But… <br></p>

<div class="bgimg12"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The limits of the transit method</b></p>
<p id="para2">Firstly, while the telescopes we use are very effective, the dips in light are very small. This makes it easiest to detect big planets, as they cause the biggest dips. But these planets aren’t habitable, so if we’re looking for alien life, we won’t find It there. It’s also easiest to detect planets around small stars.<br>
So these small stars might be hopeful candidates for harbouring life, right? Not exactly. It’s true that we’ve detected quite a few earth-like planets around small red dwarf stars, but they have a problem I think a lot of people tend to overlook with planet habitability: Radiation. The reason we’re able to detect these earth-like planets at all is because they’re so close to their red dwarf stars, but that causes them to be subject to so much radiation, you probably wouldn’t survive trying to live on one.<br>
Another problem with the transit method is how many planets it just can’t find. As planets are detected by the light they block, if they don’t move between us and the star, they won’t block the light at all. In a vast majority of the stars surveyed that have planets, said planets would not pass between the star and us. This is a major reason Kepler surveyed about 150,000 planets, yet we’ve only discovered about 4000 exoplanets total.<br>
As well as this, it’s not like planets are going to conveniently pass in front of their star the moment we look at them. They could orbit their star for years but only pass in front of it for a few hours, and we can’t wait on each star for that long. We don’t know when they’ll pass in front, as we don’t know if they’re even there when we’re looking, so there’s no way to time it.<br>
Finally, one more problem with this method is False positives – not everything that causes a dip in the star’s brightness is a planet orbiting it.<br>
It’s pretty clear that the transit method is far from perfect. Thankfully, it’s not the only method we have for finding exoplanets.<br>
Enter the radial velocity method, also known as the Doppler Spectroscopy method. This is the method with the second most results and is also the first one that was used.<br></p>

<div class="bgimg13"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>The Radial Velocity method</b></p>
<p id="para2">Planets orbit stars, right? That’s pretty obvious.<br>
But that’s actually wrong.<br>
The planets AND the star all orbit around the system’s centre of gravity. <br>
Usually, the star is so massive that the system’s centre of gravity is inside the star, just not in its exact centre. This means, while the star orbits it, it appears to wobble. This is the case with our solar system too – The sun doesn’t just stay in place. Every single object in the solar system pulls on it a little, and it wobbles as well.<br>
The radial velocity method uses this fact and is sometimes called the wobble method as a result.<br>
So, we see the star wobbling and that tells us there’s a planet around it, right?<br>
Sort of.<br>
What we actually measure from Earth is the redshift and blueshift of the light the star emits as it wobbles towards and away from us.<br>
This begs the obvious question: What are redshift and blueshift?<br></p>

<div class="bgimg14"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>Redshift and Blueshift</b></p>
<p id="para2">Redshift and blueshift are the result of something you may have heard of called the Doppler effect. As you probably know, light is a wave, as is sound. While they’re different types of wave, the doppler effect works the same with both.<br>
Let’s say something is constantly emitting some kind of wave at a precise frequency – for example, a star emitting light. And by precise frequency, I mean the time between each wave doesn’t change.<br>
If that thing moves towards you, the waves will be compressed together a bit more. If that thing moves away, there will be more space between the waves.<br>
Have you noticed how you can hear a car coming towards you for a long time, but once it passes you, the sound goes quiet a lot faster than it got louder? That’s because of the doppler effect – the waves were compressed as it came towards you, and further apart after it passed, so it took a long time to get louder, and a short time to get quieter.<br>
So, if a star is moving away, the waves appear further apart, and if it moves closer, they appear closer as well. What does that mean?<br>
Well, like I said before, frequency is how often the waves pass a certain point. If the waves are closer together, that means they have a higher frequency, and vice versa.<br>
As you may know, visible light is a spectrum of frequencies. At one end is red, with the lower frequencies, and the higher frequencies are violet, at the other end.<br>
So, an object moving away from us appears to emit a lower frequency, which means it appears redder, hence redshift. The opposite is blueshift, for an object moving towards us.<br>
Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean the light is getting redder or bluer. Light that isn’t visible to the human eye will also change in frequency. It’s just called redshift as it shifts towards the red end of the visible spectrum.<br>
So, that redshift and blueshift is what we measure – as the star wobbles around the system’s centre of gravity, it moves away from us a little, and towards us a little, causing measurable redshift and blueshift.<br>
If the shift is regular, then that means it’s being caused by an orbiting planet.<br>
Of course, this method has its limits as well.<br>
</p>

<div class="bgimg15"></div>

<p id="para1"><b>Limits of the Radial velocity method</b></p>
<p id="para2">For one thing, it’s very inaccurate when measuring mass. It can provide an estimate of the planet’s minimum mass, but that’s not very helpful. Why? Well, the redshift and blueshift of the light is only measurable in the light coming from the wobble if it’s going directly away from and towards us. This means if the star is wobbling at an angle, we can only measure a certain percentage of the wobble.<br>
This also links to an issue this method shares with the transit method: It’s most effective if the planet moves between us and the star. This is because it causes all of the star’s wobble to be towards us or away from us, so the redshift and blueshift we measure is completely accurate. If the system is face on to the Earth -  as in, the planet’s orbit around the star from our point of view is a circle around it – we won’t detect any redshift or blueshift, and thus won’t find any planets at all, even if they’re there.<br>
This method is best at detecting hot Jupiters, which are not habitable, and not really useful for anything. Planets like Earth simply aren’t detectable with this method as the wobble they cause in their star is far too small.In fact, if we do detect a hot Jupiter, that means it’s more likely an earth-like planet isn’t there. This is because hot Jupiters have very strong gravity, which would mess with any other orbiting planets.<br>
The radial velocity method accounts for about 19% of all exoplanet’s we’ve found, whereas the transit method has found about 76%<sup><a href="#Cit2">[2]</a></sup>.<br>
As said before, using these methods – and a few others – we’ve found about 4300 exoplanets. But how many are there total? And how many might we be able to survive on?<br></p>

<div class="bgimg16"></div>

<p id="para2">The current estimate for exoplanets in our galaxy is 40 billion earth-like planets in the habitable zone<sup><a href="#Cit3">[3]</a></sup>. That means about one in five sunlike stars has a planet like earth. Makes our existence seem a little less crazy, doesn’t it?<br>
Of course, this is just an estimate, and not an accurate either. However, we think most stars have at least one planet.<br>
‘We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception’ – A quote from a scientific paper you can find <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0903" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
In fact, the current estimate is that there are 1.6 planets per star in the galaxy.<br>
The number of stars in the galaxy is unknown, and estimates contain a very wide range of values. The best guess we have currently is between 100 billion and 400 billion stars<sup><a href="#Cit4">[4]</a></sup>. So, let’s take the middle of this estimate and say there are about 250 billion stars in the Milky way.<br>
1.6 x 250 billion = 400 billion.<br>
So there could be around 400,000,000,000 planets in our galaxy alone. Again, this is a very rough estimate, and should not be taken as the exact answer.<br>
If there are that many, just in our galaxy, then how about in the observable universe as a whole? Unfortunately, that’s not really a question worth answering, as the answer would be so imprecise it just wouldn’t be useful.<br>
For now, let’s just say a lot.<br>
It would be nice if we could find more than just the 4300 we’ve found so far, right? Well, exoplanet discovery is a subject at the forefront of astrophysics today, and we’re constantly searching for more, as well as improving our search methods. In fact, we’re sending out the best ever telescope for finding exoplanets pretty soon.</p>
